      "message": "Laziness.  In a block of code this short, allocated type vs. interface type makes no difference.  Even if we had used Map\u003cK,V\u003e here a good static compiler should be able to reason out that this is really LinkedHashMap\u003cK,V\u003e because the local variable is final.  I happened to have it on my clipboard or something so I used it on both sides.\n\nI do tend to also do that sort of thing when I really want to make it clear that this is a LinkedHashMap, vs. say an arbitrary Map (which could be a normal HashMap) or a SortedMap (which could be a TreeMap), as the iteration order of the entries is more significant here.\n\nAnyway, it basically boils down to \"no good reason\", and we both just wasted way more time asking why I did this and what the justification is than if I could have just read your mind and done what you expected in the first place... which clearly wasn\u0027t what I thought was the easiest thing for me at the time that I wrote this code.  Let me know when you have the Code Reviewer Mind Reading Feature implemented in Gerrit Super Extreme Code Review Professional Edition 2102.  I could use it.  :-)",
